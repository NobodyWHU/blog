先慢慢熟悉Mrakdown写博客的过程，作为新手，先从转载开始。

这都是我在Quora上发现的有意思的答案，当然大都多是和学术相关的。

This is a very good question and over the past a lot of people have asked how to prepare for a specific technical position at large companies like Google, Twitter etc.. From your description, it seems that you have two years working experiences as a software engineer, and your machine learning skills are mostly self-taught with side projects instead of production experiences. So I would give you the following suggestions.

## 1. Interviews are mostly focused on data structure/algorithms, and will have some coverage on your strengths (ML).
It is quite common in large tech companies that no matter what position you are applying for, you will get thru the very similar hiring process that interviews are mostly focused on data structure, algorithms, system design and testing. In other words, it doesn't matter if you are an IOS developer or a machine learning guy, interviews will have a lot in common.

With that in mind, you should be quite clear about what kind of questions will be asked in the interview and don't be surprised when you are asked to code something like reversing a string.

## 2. Prepare well for general technical interview
As the interview will cover a lot those general stuffs like data structure and algorithms, it's quite straightforward that you should put most of your focus on this area. Also for experienced engineers, they tend to forget most of them as they are not used quite often in real world. This is another reason you should spend enough time on this topic.

As you already had 2 years working experience, I believed that you had this kind of interview 2 years ago and know exactly how to prepare well for this part. Maybe you can check the following few resources to make it even better:

* Gainlo - We built Gainlo to allow people get mock interviews from experienced interviewer from Google, Amazon, Linkedin etc. and get real feedback to improve.

* LeetCode - Coding questions with online judge.

* Glassdoor - You can do some research about the company you apply for and practice questions from its past interviews.


## 3. Machine learning preparation
For your first question how far you can go in machine learning in industry, I would say you don't need to be a math expert in order to do ML in industry since industry is quite different from research world. In industry, the key isn't creating new algorithms or something fancy. Instead, what really matters is features you select and process, size of available data set etc., which requires more experiences rather than maths. So in short, you can definitely go achieve your ML goal without being extremely good at maths.

For you 2nd question about how to prepare the interview for ML, here are few items you should defnitely try:
Be clear about ML basic concepts. You don't need to do maths, but you should be able to explain those algorithms clearly.
Prepare with some ML interview questions. I believe you can Google a lot of them.
Learn how ML works in real world examples. Do some investigation about how different companies designed their ML systems and understand why they were designed in this way. In your interview, you won't be able to code any ML algorithms, instead you are more likely to discuss, design and optimize some ML systems. So getting to understand how other companies work is quite helpful.
